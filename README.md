# SAitYourself
This is my final project of my study.
This is a SPA (Angular 7) using a .net API and MongoDB data-base.
The app provides users to Open and build their own Business-Web-App with only few clicks.
Then the owners can manage their own web-site, integrate with their clients, show them a work gallery and manage a Schedular,
including send and recieve messages from clients and appointments requests.
As a client-user, user can register and log-in to any Business site and interact with it, 
review the Business work gallery, send messages and recieve messages from the business owner,
review the business schedular (with restriction) and send an appointment request to the owner.

This project was designed and written by Shay Zohar.
